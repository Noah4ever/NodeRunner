# 🔗🏃Node Runner Addon Documentation

## ✨Introduction

**Node Runner** is a Python addon for Blender that simplifies the process of importing and exporting shader nodes. By serializing selected shader nodes, compressing them using zlib, and encoding the result in base64, the addon generates a short, shareable string. This string can be easily copied, shared, and imported into other Blender projects.

Node Runner integrates seamlessly into Blender’s Shader Node Tab, allowing users to export and import node setups with just a few clicks.

## 🌟Features

- **📤Export Shader Nodes**: Export selected shader nodes into a compact, shareable string.
- **📥Import Shader Nodes**: Import shader nodes from a base64-encoded string, adding them to the current node tree (without replacing any existing nodes).
- **📄Context Menu Integration**: The addon is accessible via the context menu in the Shader Node Editor, making it easy to export or import nodes directly from the node workspace.

## 🚀Usage

### 🔧Accessing Node Runner in Blender

1. In the Shader Node Editor, select the nodes you want to export.
2. Right-click on the selected nodes to open the context menu.
3. You will see two new options:

- **Node Runner Export**: To export the selected nodes.
- **Node Runner Import**: To import nodes from a base64-encoded string.

### 📤Exporting Shader Nodes

1. **Select Nodes**: In the Shader Node Editor, select the nodes you wish to export.
2. **Right-click**: Open the context menu by right-clicking on the selected nodes.
3. **Node Runner Export**: Choose the Node Runner Export option.
4. **Copy Export String**: A dialog box will open with an input field containing the base64-encoded export string. Copy this string to share or store for later use.

### 📥Importing Shader Nodes

1. **Right-click**: Open the context menu by right-clicking in an empty space in the Shader Node Editor.
2. **Node Runner Import**: Choose the Node Runner Import option.
3. **Paste the Import String**: A dialog box will appear with an empty input field. Paste the base64-encoded string of the exported nodes into this field.
4. **Confirm**: Press Enter or confirm the dialog to import the nodes into your current node setup. The imported nodes will be added without replacing any existing nodes.

### ⚠️Troubleshooting

- **Empty Input Field During Import**: Ensure that you have copied the correct base64-encoded string generated by Node Runner. Verify that the string is complete and properly formatted.

### 🚧Limitations

- Node Runner only supports shader nodes.
- Imported nodes are added to the current node tree and do not replace any existing nodes.
- External assets (e.g., textures) referenced by the nodes will not be included in the export and must be manually re-linked.
