## Overview

This **Blender Python Addon** allows you to easily **import and export shader nodes** to a simple **string format**. The exported strings can be easily shared through text messengers, YouTube comments, or any other text-based platform, allowing you to quickly share node setups without the need to send actual files.

With this addon, sharing and reusing shader node setups becomes as simple as copying and pasting a line of text!

## Features

- **ðŸš€ Export Shader Nodes**: Converts your current shader node setup into a compact string that can be copied and shared.
- **ðŸ”„ Import Shader Nodes**: Paste a shared shader node string to recreate the exact node setup in your own Blender project.
- **ðŸ’¬ Text-Based Sharing**: Exported node strings are lightweight and can be shared via messengers, social media, or even in YouTube comments.
